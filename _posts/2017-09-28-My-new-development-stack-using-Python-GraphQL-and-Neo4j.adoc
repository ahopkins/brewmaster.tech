Okay, let's sit down to create a new game.

_Step 1. Open text editor._ Done. This is easy.

Hmm ... Geez, maybe I should break out of my shell and try something new.

I have developed MANY applications of all sorts of shapes and sizes using the https://www.djangoproject.com[Django Framework]. I am a huge supporter of it from the early days, and strongly believe it still has a long future.

But, what about all these new things out there? Sure, I can jam stuff into Django, or even replace the ORM with something else. I even had started working on a package to bring https://github.com/ahopkins/elasticmanager[Elasticsearch into the Django model manager].

This time, I want something different. Let's start by adding GraphQL to the stack.

    My Stack
    ========
    [X] GraphQL

How am I going to interface with the specification inside Python? Ahh, http://graphene-python.org[Graphene]. What an amazing package!

Basically, you create a schema that looks very much like any ORM: a series of classes with fields that map to attributes. This raises a problem though.

You see, when developing my `elasticmanager` package, I initially grabbed the existing Django ORM models and looped over them to generate a schema that fit inside https://elasticsearch-dsl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[`elasticsearch_dsl`]. The problem was that this did not give me enough flexibility. So, I took that out and created two sets of schemas: Django models, and elasticsearch datatypes. Once I added Django REST Framework into the mix, I now had a third schema! I want to avoid this problem on this project.

So, I need to be able to have one defined schema, and that will be graphene.

    My Stack
    ========
    [X] GraphQL
    [X] Graphene

Well, what about database you say? I thought about Postgres (my typical go to). Seeing how this is a side project and I am already taking on new technologies, maybe I should see what else is out there that I don't know.

Enter https://neo4j.com[Neo4j].

Neo4j is a relational graph database that comes with its own query language called cypher. Probably a topic for another post. Suffice it to say that cypher is both extremely comfortable and natural to write, and hugely powerful.

Back to my stack.

How am I going to interact with Neo4j? There is a really neat package that looks EXACTLY like Django ORM: http://neomodel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[`neomodel`]. That certainly would be an easy transition; I can already tell how I would interact with it. It looks like the code I have been writing for a long time. It does, however, seem like a little bit of a cop out though since it generates all the cypher queries for you. Do I abstract that away with neomodel? Or, take it head on and learn it.

Again, this is a side project, what do you think the answer is?

    My Stack
    ========
    [X] GraphQL
    [X] Graphene
    [X] Neo4j, without an ORM layer

Now my backend is starting to shape up. I am still missing, however, the key component to bind it altogether. I already decided to NOT build with Django. I suppose Flask, Bottle, or Pyramid.

Hmm ... thinking about the frontend though, I REALLY want to have a tightly coupled chat application and live streaming data. It really seems like something meant for WebSockets.

Since Django is out, that means the awesome https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[Django Channels] (my typical WebSockets interface) is out. What next?

Tom Christie of DRF fame has been working on a new API project called https://discuss.apistar.org[`apistar`]. It does not currently handle the sort of connections I am looking for, but he also worked on a project called http://www.uvicorn.org[`uvicorn`]. That looks promising.

And, there are a few frameworks I hear about utilizing asyncio, namely and http://sanic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/[Sanic].

Ooo, someone made a connection for https://github.com/graphql-python/sanic-graphql[Sanic with GraphQL]. With one line of code I can hook up GraphQL and Grapehne. 

	app.add_route(GraphQLView.as_view(schema=Schema, graphiql=True), '/graphql')


And it handles both HTTP and WebSockets. I'm sold.

    My Stack
    ========
    [X] GraphQL
    [X] Graphene
    [X] Neo4j, without an ORM layer
    [X] Sanic
        - HTTP
        - WebSocket

Now ... I just need to hook this all up. That was surprisingly easy. Here is how I did it.

[source,python]
----
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import text
from graphene import ObjectType, List, Schema, String, Field, AbstractType
from sanic_graphql import GraphQLView
from neo4j.v1 import GraphDatabase

import copy

uri = "bolt://localhost:7687"
driver = GraphDatabase.driver(uri, auth=("neo4j", "<PASSWORD>"))


def query(cypher, **kwargs):
    with driver.session() as session:
        with session.begin_transaction() as tx:
            return tx.run(cypher, **kwargs)


league_attributes = {
    'abbreviation': String(),
    'name': String(),
}


class LeagueAbstract(AbstractType):
    def resolve_name(self, args, context, info):
        return self['l'].get('name')

    def resolve_abbreviation(self, args, context, info):
        return self['l'].get('abbreviation')


League = type('League', (LeagueAbstract, ObjectType), copy.deepcopy(league_attributes))


class Query(ObjectType):
    leagues = List(League, copy.deepcopy(league_attributes))
    league = Field(League, copy.deepcopy(league_attributes))

    def resolve_leagues(self, args, context, info):
        abbreviation = args.get('abbreviation', None)
        abbr = 'WHERE l.abbreviation={abbreviation}' if abbreviation is not None else ''
        cypher = f'MATCH (l:League) {abbr} RETURN l;'
        records = query(cypher, abbreviation=abbreviation)
        return records

    def resolve_league(self, args, context, info):
        abbreviation = args.get('abbreviation')
        cypher = 'MATCH (l:League) WHERE l.abbreviation={abbreviation} RETURN l;'
        records = query(cypher, abbreviation=abbreviation)
        return records.single()


schema = Schema(query=Query)

app = Sanic(__name__)

app.add_route(GraphQLView.as_view(schema=schema, graphiql=True), '/')

app.run(host="127.0.0.1", port=8000, debug=True)
----

This is my proof of concept. Clearly this script needs to be cleaned up and abstracted away into modules.

But, the point of the matter is that when taking on a side project. Step out of the comfort zone and grab a whole bunch of new tools. Because, in doing so, I have been inspired to https://github.com/ahopkins/asynccli[to build] https://github.com/ahopkins/sanic-jwt[several] https://github.com/ahopkins/merkava[new tools]. All three of those mini side projects has been fun. And I would have built none of them if I had stayed inside the lines.

Go ahead. Build something new.
