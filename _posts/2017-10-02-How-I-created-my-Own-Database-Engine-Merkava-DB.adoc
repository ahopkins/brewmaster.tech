= How I created my Own Database Engine: Merkava DB

First you may be wondering, *why* create your own database? With all the many options out there, what possessed you to think this was a good idea?

Well, simply put, the DB I wanted to use just did not exist. Besides, as I said before, on side projects, it is good to extend your boundaries. It is (in part) also the same reason that I built a Javascript framework.

I had been working on a side project that had a need for storing short snippets of data in a time series fashion. Basically, I wanted to write a whole bunch of data, and recall it in the order it came out. Sounds kind of like a chat feed huh? Yup. That's what I needed.

My project had already shirked the land of SQL relational databases. It was running a hybrid of Neo4j and Redis. Neither seemed quite up to the task that I needed. So, in steps Merkava DB. This is, more or less, the process that I took over the course of spare time I scrounged during three days.

Now, it is not a fully ACID compliant, highly scalable solution to hang your hat on. But, my requirements as the backend for a chat server were small. Support fast read/write operations that reliably allow me to retrieve data in the same order that I store it.

== Question #1: How do I persist to file?

I suppose even before I asked this question, I needed to decide what programming language or languages I was going to use. My very first instinct was to use Python with some C extensions to drop down into C where needed for  performance gains.

I looked around to see what else was out there, thinking that some other persistable solutions could easily be taken off the shelf (pun intended) and applied. The Python shelf module looked promising, until I saw its performance ratings. This was simply not acceptable.

Looking around some more, I was highy interested in the `ujson` package. It is basically a drop in replacement for the standard library's `json` module, but WAY faster. It had the added benefit of making the files human readable. However, this was not a project requirement. I do not care about whether the files are human readable or not. Consistency and speed are the priorities. It was plausible solution, but not the solution.

Then I saw 

== Question #2: How should user's interact with the DB?

== What's next?

=== Drivers

=== Single executable install, or maybe `.deb` package
